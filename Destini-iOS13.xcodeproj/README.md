## My Goal

The goal of this challenge is to get you comfortable with implementing the MVC design pattern and thinking about the state of my app. 

## What I created

In this app, I Created a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience

## What Skills I learned

* I learned to have directed output based on input
* I learned to transfer data across the MVC design pattern code.
* I practiced creating new structs and inits.
* I learned to direct my code to specific output.
