## The Goal

The goal was to begin learning the wonderful world of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to grab live data from the internet. I also wanted to practice using iOS features such as dark mode, UITextField for user input, and URLSession.

## What I Created

I made a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app. You'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

## What Skills I Learned

* How to create a dark-mode enabled app.
* How to use vector images as image assets.
* Learn to use the UITextField to get user input. 
* Learn about the delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions. 
* Swift guard keyword. 
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* How to use APIâ€™s in swift code.
* Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Learn to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
* Learn to use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
