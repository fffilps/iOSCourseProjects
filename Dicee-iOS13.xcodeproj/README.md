# Dicee

## My Goal Goal

The objective of this app was to introduce me to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps. 

## What I Created

I created a Las Vegas dice app. I made the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking the phone. The app visually shows the dice and them changing.

## What I learned

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* How to make changes in my apps programmatically.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* Learn to use comments to annotate code.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* How to test and debug my app with the Xcode console.
* Learn about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
