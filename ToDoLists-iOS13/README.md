#ToDoLists App

## The Goal

The Goal of this app was to build a custom made TableView that dealt with Persistent Data. I wanted to learn different ways to use persistent data and the differences from each way. I also wanted to learn to use more APIs to customize the appearance of my apps.


## What I Created

I created an app that has 2 pages with the first being Categories, that then segues into the next screen of Items on the list to do. The app is color gradient to show each Category. Each Category when selected keeps the color for the items page. You have the option to check your completed task or delete them. You can delete them by swiping right( it has 2 swipe right options [: )
