# Xylophone

## My Goal

The goal was to learn how to play sound on a app and use an Apple library called AVFoundation for future projects.

## What I Created

I made my first musical instrument! Its a colorful XyloPhone app that actually plays sounds based on which note you tap. It takes your input (touch) and plays a sound back based on that note you tap.

## What I learned

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* Understand Apple documentation and how to use StackOverflow.
* Functions and methods in Swift. 
* Data types.
* Swift loops.
* Variable scope.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* Error handling in Swift.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging.
