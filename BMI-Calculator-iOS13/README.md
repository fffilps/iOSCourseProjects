#  BMI Calculator

## The Goal

The goal of this this project was to learn more about Optionals, solidify my  understanding of the MVC design pattern and to begin using the concept of Classes. I practiced using objects created from classes with instances of Structs.

## What I Created

Made a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on your input.

## What skills I learned

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs.
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference.
* Formatting Strings.
* Color literals.
