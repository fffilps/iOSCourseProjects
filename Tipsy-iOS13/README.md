## My Goal

The Goal of this app was to get more practice using segue transitions and taking user input for calculated output.

## What I Created

I made a Tip Calculating app. This Tip app can also split the amount due if you are with a group of people. The app takes the users Meal amount, tip percentage, and amount of people, to then calculate how much each person would pay. 

## What Skills I Exercised 

* The use of segues for multi-screen apps.
* Formatting strings.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* App Design Challenge.
* Creating Swift Classes
* Using UIButtons
