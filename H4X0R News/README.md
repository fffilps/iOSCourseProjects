## The Goal

The Goal of this app was to practice using an API, SwiftUI, and TableView all in one project.

## What I Created

H4X0R news is just an app version of HackerNews (news.ycombinator.com). Its a tableview based app that is populated with the top, newest articles from the website. Once you click on one of the articles, it does segue into a browser window with the article in it.

## What Skills I Practiced

* Using a websites public API
* Creating an app with SwiftUI
* Using multiple Files to populate a SwiftUI Project
* Populating a TableView with live data from an API
* Creating a segue into another window with information.
* Creating a Browser Window using WKWebView
