# Magic 8 Ball

## My Goal

The objective of this app is to apply the skills I learned in the Dicee app and get myself used to making simple apps. This app is to exercise my muscle memory with app developing foundational concepts.

## What I Created

I created the Magic 8 Ball Simulator app. You can ask the app to make all your hard decisions, like you would a real 8 ball. It also has pictures and animation changes like a real 8 ball.

## What Skills I Exercised 

* Created an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Created links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Use of Swift constants and variables.
* Usage of Arrays and accessing the data inside of them.
* Randomisation in Swift.
* Programmatically changed images on the UI.
