# Egg Timer

![EggTimer Demo](/EggTimer.xcodeproj/EggTimer/Documentation/EggTimer.mov)

## My Goal

To get comfortable with looking up how to do something I've never done before using Google search, StackOverflow and Apple Documentation to make the code do what I want it to. I also wanted to learn some new Swift programming concepts. 

## What I Made

I built a beautiful egg timer app to boil eggs to perfection depending on how you prefer your eggs (Soft, Medium, or Hard). (This app doesnt use actual boiling time as its a demostration of skill)

## What Skills I Learned

* Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
* The Swift Timer API
* Conditional statements - IF/ELSE
* Conditional statements - Switch
* Functions with outputs
* How to use the ProgressView
