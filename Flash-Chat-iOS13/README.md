# Flash-Chat

## My Goal

I needed to have grips and understanding with Table Views, as its one of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. I also wanted to learn to create custom cells and make my own cloud-based backend database.

## What I Created

Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app. I used a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve the messages from the cloud. 

## What I Learned

* How to integrate third party libraries in my apps using Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.
* How to store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
* How to query and sort the Firebase database.
* How to use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.
* How to work with UITableViews and how to set their data sources and delegates.
* How to create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.
* How to embed View Controllers in a Navigation Controller and understand the navigation stack.
* How to create a constants file and use static properties to store Strings and other constants.
* Techniques on how to use Swift loops and create animations using loops.
* About the App Lifecycle and how to use viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear.
* How to create direct Segues for navigation.
