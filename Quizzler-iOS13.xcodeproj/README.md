# Quizzler

## Our Goal

The goal of this app was to take myself one step further in my journey of becoming an app developer. I wanted to implement the holy grail of mobile design patterns: the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. I wanted to also practice checking user selections for correct or incorrect answers

## What I Created

I created a trivia quiz app. Like other trivia apps, you will select between a choice of answers. If you get the answer correct the answer will flash green and credit you a score. The app will keep the score tally as well.

## What Skills I Learned

* How to programmatically change UI elements such as Labels and Buttons.
* What is a design pattern and how is it used in programming.
* How to use the Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Learn about Swift Structures how to instantiate a struct instance.
* Understand the difference between value types and reference types.
* Learn about Swift Classes and creating Objects.
* Compare Swift Classes with Swift Structs and know when to use which.
* Learn about Object Oriented Programming.
* How to refactor code and stay organized.
